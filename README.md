## What is Framis?

Most window managers make you drag windows into zones. Framis flips that — you pick a zone first, then choose which window goes there.

This means you can target specific windows, even when you have multiple windows from the same app.

## Features

- **Zone → Window workflow** — Select a zone, pick a window. No dragging.
- **8 built-in layouts** — Split, thirds, maximize, and more
- **Window search** — Type to filter windows by name
- **Multi-monitor** — Per-display layouts with resolution awareness
- **Keyboard-driven** — Full keyboard navigation in Arrange Mode
- **Customizable hotkey** — Set your preferred shortcut to enter Arrange Mode

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Arrange Mode (default: Ctrl + Option + F)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
